# CS-360-Mobile-Architect-and-Programming

I chose to work on Option 1: Inventory App. <br>
The overarching purpose of the Inventory App is to provide users with a tool for efficiently managing and tracking items in a warehouse. Key components necessary to support the app's goals include:<br>
Database: A database with at least two tables, one to store the inventory items and one to store user logins and passwords.
User Authentication Screen: A screen for logging into the app to implement security. Note that this should also be used to create a login if the user has never logged in before.
Inventory Display Screen: A screen, with a grid, that displays all items in the inventory.
Item Management Screen A mechanism by which the user can add and remove items from inventory. The user can increase or decrease the number of a specific item in the inventory.
Inventory Alerts: A mechanism by which the application will notify the user when the amount of any item in the inventory has been reduced to 0 (zero)<br>

Potential users of the application will be: 
Warehouse Inventory Control Manager: to monitor existing inventory levels, manage needed inventory orders and respond to alerts.
Warehouse Inventory Accountant: to easily view and evaluate the existing inventory and its worth and cost to replenish.
Warehouse Inventory Analyst: to analyze trends, generate reports, and optimize inventory workflows.<br>
Screens that need to be developed will be: <br><br>
<b>User Authentication Screen:</b><br>
HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTION:<br>
A screen for logging into the app to implement security. Note that this should also be used to create a login if the user has never logged in before.<br>
USER MOVEMENTS: <br>
The user is able to enter their username and password to log into the app or click on “Create an account” to enter a username, email and password for the new account. They can also go back to login.<br><br>
<b>Inventory Display Screen:</b><br>
HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTION:<br> 
A screen, with a grid, that displays all items in the inventory.<br>
USER MOVEMENTS:<br> 
The user can click on one of the categories for inventory to view the details of the category or search. On the category detail screen, the user can click on the row to edit or delete. They can also add a new item. Or go back to the previous screen.<br><br>
<b>Item Management Screen:</b><br>

<b>Inventory Alerts:</b><br>
HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTION:<br> 
A mechanism by which the application will notify the user when the amount of any item in the inventory has been reduced to 0 (zero)<br>
USER MOVEMENTS:<br> 
On the category main screen (not shown but would have “!” by the user icon), category detail screen, and the item detail screen (edit) an alert can notify the user by putting a red “!” by the user account and marking the low item with red text color in each screen.<br>

I began by gathering information about the app's needed features and user needs.I created mockups to visualize the app's layout and flow keeping the design clean and minimal to fit screen sizes of various devices.
For this class we used Android Studio, Kotlin/Java for coding, and XML for layout design.
It helped to divide implentation of functionality into smaller, manageable tasks.
With the time limitation and I would have to say I followed a more end-to-end testing but also stopping to create functional stops and back them up as changes were made. I also took the step to have user testing by self declared "technically challenged" people. With the basic design developed I would like to return and add the functionality that time did not permit during this term.
